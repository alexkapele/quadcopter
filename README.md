### Description

A reinforcement learning agent was designed and trained in order to control a quadcopter autonomously. A task was first defined (to take-off and hover at a given height) and then an agent was trained to perform this task by controlling the thrust of the quadcopter's 4 rotors. The reinforcement learning technique that was used is an Actor-Critic method known as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). More details about this technique can be found in the Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning [paper] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).
